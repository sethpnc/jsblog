# jsblog
Very basic blog using Javascript with JQuery and a simple REST backend.

This was a project done over two days as an exercise to brush up on javascript, learn JQuery, and learn how to make RESTful calls to API and manipulate JSON objects.

The API endpoints used were temporary and will likely be disabled, but the logic should be fairly easy to modify to use a different endpoint with simple values.

The blog interactions are not elegant, but do work.

Delete actions are not visible via URL.
